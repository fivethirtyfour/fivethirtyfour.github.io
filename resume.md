## About me

I love a challenge. The adventure of learning something new, solving a problem that hasn’t been solved or wasn’t even known to be a problem, tearing something apart to figure out how it works, and helping people understand their technical issues and teach them how to better approach a resolution; these are the things that make me tick.

In each role that I have taken on I have worked from the ground up. I believe this is the best approach to understand the problem the organization is trying to resolve. Staying in touch with the base goals helps simplify the problems at the top.

Leveraging my problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills I have worked to understand the customer or the business problem that needs to be solved. With this approach I have saved non-profits and small to medium sized businesses thousands of dollars in technical costs while at the same time streamlined processes and tasks internally to increase profit margins and reduce man hours.

## Experience

### Apricity | Consulting IT Manager

October 2017 - Present (2 years 6 months)

Neenah, WI (Remote)

- Designed, developed and deployed a Ruby on Rails application to track notes and progress of clients through the residential treatment program. On the frontend the primary focuses were to design an intuitive application so even the least technically savvy person could navigate and undertand the application without much training. On the backend I focused on using an easy to understand, robust, and human readible development framework so support, maintenance, and future development would be easy and intuitive for anyone with coding knowledge to start fixing bugs and continue to build additional features.
- Deployed self-hosted VPS to reduce the hosting costs of web applications while owning the devops process, security infrastructure, and monitoring of business critical applications.
- Headed the technical implementation and merger of two non-profits to exist as a single entity. Worked closely with the executives, vendors, and team leads of both organizations to plan and implement the technical changes that would be required to operate as a single entity.
- Migrated all cloud and local environments to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure cloud infrastructure. By removing local environments and utilizing Microsoft’s excellent non-profit sponsorship programs I was able to reduce technical debt and technical costs while also improving the productivity of the employees by removing technical barriers and physical location barriers.
- Moved all essential and non-essential local server based applications to Azure cloud infrastructure. Virtualized mission critical applications which increased their availability and access to the employees, reducing friction and improving productivity.
- Identified a critical security vulnerability in our electronic medical records software that allowed global administrative privileges to the applications database. This vulnerability affected every installation of the application. Upon discovering the vulnerability, I worked closely with a security firm to develop a plan for responsible public disclosure, which included contacting the vendor and working with them to assist with a fix before the public disclosure. While waiting for a fix, implemented whitelists and other on-premises tactics to reduce the risk of compromised data.
- Designed, developed, and deployed multiple corporate websites to represent the three divisions of the business; overall organization, residential treatment, and contract packaging. The technical focus of the websites was to deploy modern mobile first and responsive code, while maintaining secure coding practices to have the best user experience to people discovering our services.
